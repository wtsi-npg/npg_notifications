This application sends email notifications to the contacts of the studies associated
with Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) runs. The emails are triggered by events such as
the run being uploaded to iRODS or basecalled.

The application can be run in two modes: 'add' or 'run'.

In 'add' mode, the application reads ONT run collections in baton JSON format from a
file or STDIN, one per line. These collections must have the standard ONT run metadata:

    - ont:experiment_name
    - ont:instrument_slot
    - ont:flowcell_id

For each collection, a new task is created and added to the Porch server. The collection
is then written to a file or STDOUT in baton JSON format, one per line.

In 'run' mode, the application retrieves any ONT event email tasks that have not been
done from the Porch server and runs them to send notifications. For each task, an email
is sent to all the contacts of the studies associated with the run.

The type of event to be reported in the email can be specified with the --event option.

The application requires a configuration file that specifies the Porch server URL and
authentication token, and the MySQL MLWH database connection details. The configuration
file should be in INI format and have the following sections:

    [MySQL MLWH]
    dbhost = <MySQL host>
    dbport = <MySQL port>
    dbuser = <MySQL user>
    dbpassword = <MySQL password>
    dbschema = <MySQL schema>

    [PORCH]
    url = <Porch server URL>
    admin_token = <Porch server admin authentication token>
    pipeline_token = <Porch server pipeline authentication token>
