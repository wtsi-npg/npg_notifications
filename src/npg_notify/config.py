    """
    Parses a configuration file and returns its content.

    Allows for two types of configuration files, 'ini' and 'json'. The type of
    the file is determined from the extension of the file name. In case of no
    extension an 'ini' type is assumed.

    The content of the file is not cached, so subsequent calls to get data from
    the same configuration file result in re-reading and re-parsing of the file.

    Args:

      conf_file_path:
        A configuration file with database connection details.
      conf_file_section:
        The section of the configuration file. Optional. Should be defined
        for 'ini' files.

    Returns:
      For an 'ini' file returns the content of the given section of the file as
      a dictionary.
      For a 'json' file, if the conf_file_section argument is not defined, the
      content of a file as a Python object is returned. If the conf_file_section
      argument is defined, the object returned by the parser is assumed to be
      a dictionary that has the value of the 'conf_file_section' argument as a key.
      The value corresponding to this key is returned.
